# **Airbnb Clone Backend Project**

## **Overview**
This project is a **backend implementation of an Airbnb Clone**, designed to replicate core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. Built with **.NET Core 8**, it focuses on clean architecture, scalability, and real-time communication. It provides seamless features for user authentication, property listings, booking management, and notification services.  

Whether youâ€™re a developer exploring modern .NET practices or a stakeholder looking for a robust solution, this project demonstrates best practices, including **CQRS**, **Dependency Injection**, and real-time notifications with **SignalR**.

## **Project Architecture**

This project adopts the **Clean Architecture** approach to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of testing.

### **Core Layers**
1. **Domain Layer**
   - Contains the core business entities, interfaces, and rules.
   - Example: `Property`, `User`, `Booking`.

2. **Application Layer**
   - Handles business logic, services, and use cases.
   - Includes MediatR handlers, validation, and mapping logic.

3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Handles communication with external systems.
   - Manages database context (EF Core), Redis caching, and SignalR hubs.

4. **Presentation Layer (API)**
   - Provides endpoints for the frontend to interact with the backend.
   - Includes controllers and middleware for request/response handling.

### **Advantages**
- **Scalability:** Layers can be extended independently.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has a distinct responsibility.
- **Testability:** Business logic is isolated for easier unit testing.
- **Flexibility:** Technologies like Redis and SignalR are decoupled from core business logic.

## **Design Patterns**
This project implements several design patterns:
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):**
  - Separates the read and write operations to enhance performance and maintainability.
- **Repository Pattern:**
  - Centralizes database queries to keep the codebase clean and testable.
- **Singleton Pattern:**
  - Ensures a single instance of Redis client and connection manager.
- **Observer Pattern:**
  - Used in SignalR to push real-time notifications to connected clients.
- **Dependency Injection:**
  - Achieved via ASP.NET Core's built-in DI container for better modularity.

## **Database Schema**

### **Key Tables**
1. **Users**: Stores user credentials and profile details.
2. **Properties**: Contains property details like description, location, and images.
3. **Bookings**: Tracks property reservations and booking statuses.
4. **Notifications**: Stores notifications for system-wide and user-specific messages.

---

## **Redis Integration**

Redis is utilized for:
- **Session Caching:** Reduces database load by caching frequently used user session data.
- **Property Listings Cache:** Enhances response time for property search and filters.
- **Notifications Cache:** Stores user-specific notification data for quick access.

### **Configuration**
Ensure Redis is running and update the connection string in `appsettings.json`:
```json
"Redis": {
  "ConnectionString": "localhost:6379"
}
